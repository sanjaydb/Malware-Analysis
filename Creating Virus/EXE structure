DOS Header: 
            The DOS header is a small section of the EXE file that contains information specific to the DOS operating system. 
            It includes details such as the executable file signature, file size, and the location of the initial entry point for program execution.

DOS Stub: 
            The DOS stub is a small block of code that is executed when the EXE file is run on a DOS-based system. 
            This code typically displays a message or performs some other basic operation before passing control to the main executable portion of the file.

PE (Portable Executable) Header: 
            The PE header is a crucial part of the EXE file structure and contains information about the executable file that is used by the Windows operating system. 
            It includes details such as the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), sections, import and export tables, entry point address, and more.

Section Headers: 
            The section headers define the different sections or segments of the executable file. These sections contain various data, 
            such as code, data, resources, and more. Each section has its own characteristics, such as permissions (read, write, execute), size, and memory location.

Import and Export Tables: 
            The import table lists the functions and libraries that the executable relies on but does not contain internally. 
            It specifies which functions are needed from external libraries and provides the addresses where those functions can be found. 
            The export table lists the functions or symbols that the executable exposes to other programs or libraries.

Resource Data: 
            The resource data section contains additional data associated with the executable, such as icons, images, strings, version information, and other resources 
            that the program uses.

Relocation Data: 
            The relocation data section contains information used by the operating system to adjust memory addresses 
            if the executable is loaded at a different base address than its preferred location. 
            It enables the program to run correctly even when loaded into memory at a different address.

Optional Header: 
            The optional header provides additional information about the executable, 
            including the preferred base address, image size, stack size, entry point address, subsystem type (console or GUI), 
            and other characteristics specific to the Windows operating system.

Code and Data Sections: 
            The code and data sections contain the actual instructions (code) and data used by the executable program. 
            The code section holds the executable instructions that are executed by the processor, 
            while the data section holds variables, constants, and other data used by the program.
