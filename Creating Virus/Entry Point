 Understanding these concepts is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

When a virus infects a binary file, it often looks for the Import and Export Tables within the file. These tables contain information about the functions and libraries 
that the binary relies on (Import Table) and the functions or symbols that the binary exposes to other programs (Export Table). 

By modifying or hijacking entries in the Import Table, the virus can redirect function calls to its own malicious code or 
manipulate the behavior of the infected binary.

Similarly, the Export Table can be targeted by viruses to add their own malicious functions or replace legitimate functions with malicious counterparts. This allows the virus to extend its influence and execute its malicious actions within the infected binary.

In some cases, viruses may modify or manipulate the import table of an executable to hijack the functionality of legitimate functions or introduce their own malicious code. Here are a few ways viruses could interact with the import table:

Hooking: 
        Viruses can employ techniques like API hooking to intercept calls to legitimate functions. By modifying the import table, 
        they redirect these function calls to their own code instead, allowing them to execute malicious actions or manipulate data.

Function Modification: 
      Viruses may overwrite the addresses of legitimate functions in the import table with their own malicious code. 
      When the infected program calls these functions, it inadvertently executes the virus's code instead, enabling unauthorized activities.

Adding New Entries: 
      Viruses can add new entries to the import table to introduce their own malicious functions or libraries. 
      This allows them to extend the functionality of the infected program with their own code, which can be used for malicious purposes.

Import Address Table (IAT) Modification: 
      The Import Address Table (IAT) is a data structure that holds the addresses of imported functions. 
      Viruses can modify the IAT entries to redirect function calls to their own code, effectively replacing legitimate functionality with malicious behavior.
