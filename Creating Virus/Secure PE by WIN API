Windows API functions that can help secure the PE (Portable Executable) structure of a binary:

SetProcessDEPPolicy: 
        This function allows you to enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for a process. 
        DEP helps prevent the execution of code in data-only memory regions, mitigating common exploitation techniques such as buffer overflows.

VirtualProtect: 
      This function enables you to change the memory protection attributes of a specified region of virtual memory. 
      You can use it to mark sensitive sections of your PE file, such as import tables or code sections, as read-only or execute-only to 
      prevent unauthorized modifications or execution.

SetDllDirectory: 
      When loading DLLs, it is recommended to use a specific directory to avoid DLL search order hijacking vulnerabilities. 
      The SetDllDirectory function allows you to set a search path explicitly, reducing the risk of loading malicious or untrusted DLLs.

CheckTokenMembership: 
      Use this function to determine whether a specified security identifier (SID) is present in the access token of the current process. 
      It can be useful to verify if the process has the necessary privileges or membership in specific security groups before executing sensitive operations.

Cryptography Functions (e.g., CryptAcquireContext, CryptGenKey): 
      Utilize Windows cryptographic functions to implement secure encryption and decryption routines for protecting sensitive data within your application. 
      These functions provide access to various cryptographic algorithms and key management features.

Secure Coding Practices: 
      While not specific to Windows API functions, adopting secure coding practices, such as input validation, secure memory handling, proper error handling, 
      and secure storage of sensitive information, is essential to ensure the overall security of your PE structure :P
