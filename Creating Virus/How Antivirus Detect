Antivirus software uses various techniques to detect and identify potentially malicious or infected binaries. 
While the specific methods employed may vary between antivirus products, here are some common approaches:

Signature-based Detection: 
            Antivirus software maintains a database of known malware signatures. During a scan, the software compares the binary's code or 
            specific patterns within the file against its signature database. If a match is found, it indicates the presence of malware.

Heuristic Analysis: 
            Antivirus software employs heuristics to identify suspicious behavior or characteristics that may indicate the presence of malware. 
            This can include analyzing the binary's structure, code, or behavior to detect potentially malicious activity.

Behavioral Analysis: 
            Antivirus software monitors the runtime behavior of executables, observing their actions and interactions with the system. 
            If the binary exhibits suspicious behavior, such as modifying critical files, attempting to access sensitive resources, or 
            performing unauthorized actions, it may be flagged as potentially malicious.

Sandbox and Virtual Machine Analysis: 
            Antivirus software may execute binaries in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine, to observe their behavior 
            without risking harm to the host system. This analysis helps identify any malicious activity exhibited by the binary.

Machine Learning and AI: 
            Some antivirus solutions utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect and classify malware. 
            These algorithms learn from large datasets of known malware samples and can identify new or unknown threats based on patterns and 
            similarities with previously seen malware.

Regarding the import table specifically, while antivirus software may analyze various aspects of a binary file, such as its structure and behavior, 
they do not exclusively rely on the import table for detection. 

Antivirus engines utilize a combination of techniques to identify malware, including code analysis, signature matching, behavioral heuristics, and other methods, to provide comprehensive protection against threats.
